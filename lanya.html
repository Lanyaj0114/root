        This video really motivates me for a few reasons. The first reason is because I hope to make a <b>difference</b> in these very communities. The narrator of the video seems to be making a mockery of these neighborhoods and the people that occupy them. I hope to <b>change lives</b> and in turn change the perspective of the citizens and of these neighborhoods.

        I have already learned so many <u>life changing tools</u> during my time at ICStars In <b>Cycle 52</b>

<ul>
<li>I've learned the importance of Diversity and Inclusion</li>
<li>I definitely discovered that I can do anything I put my mind too</li>
<li>I found out that I am doing this for ME</li>
</ul>

        The Marathon continues!
